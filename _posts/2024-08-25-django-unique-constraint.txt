How to add a new unique constraint to a Django model (using Postgres), when there are millions of rows, without server downtime?
---
Recently, a moderately high volume Django site started to fail on MultipleObjectsReturned. The offending model was 
an advertisement impression counter. For each ad, day combination there is a row in the database.

The counters are created dynamically using get_or_create(). This method does not guarantee uniqueness, unless the 
model has unique constraint for the fields used in filtering. Fortunately, the related table did not have too 
many rows.

While investigating this, I learned what to do if the table has millions of rows. I have not tested 
the code below, because I did not need it. It is here for reference only.

### 1. Temporary fix

If the production is failing, you may need to have a quick, temporary fix. In my case, 
replacing get_or_create() with filter() and first() was enough to make the system work for the current day.

### 2. Fix the data

Do whatever you can to delete the duplicates. In my case, I counted the totals for the counters. Note that 
the code below is not transactional, and may lose some counts.

```python
from django.db import migrations

def remove_duplicate_entries(apps, schema_editor):
    ImpressionCounter = apps.get_model('ads', 'ImpressionCounter')
    seen = dict()
    for counter in ImpressionCounter.objects.all():
        identifier = (counter.ad_id, counter.impression_date)
        if identifier in seen:
            seen[identifier].counter += counter.counter
            seen[identifier].save()
            counter.delete()
        else:
            seen[identifier] = counter

class Migration(migrations.Migration):

    dependencies = [
        ('ads', '0011_alter_click_index_together'),
    ]

    operations = [
        migrations.RunPython(remove_duplicate_entries, migrations.RunPython.noop),
    ]
```

### 3. Add an index to the model

```python
class ImpressionCounter(models.Model):
    ...    

    class Meta:
        ...
        indexes = [
            models.Index(fields=['ad', 'impression_date'], name="index_impression_counter"),
        ]
```

### 4. Create the migration for the index

```bash
% python manage.py makemigrations
```

This will create a migration for an index. If you have lots of data, this would lock the table for a long
time. Luckily Django has a new CreateIndexConcurrently feature which we can use.

To use it, open the generated migration file and change the AddIndex to AddIndexConcurrently and
RemoveIndex to RemoveIndexConcurrently. AddIndexConcurrently and RemoveIndexConcurrently were introduced in 
in Django 3.0.

Give a name to the index, so you can reference it when creating the constraint.

```bash
% python manage.py sqlmigrate ads 0013
```

### 5. Add the constraint to the model

Django has two ways to make field combinations unique: the older unique_together and the newer constraints. The former
may be deprecated in the future, so it makes sense to use the latter.

```python
class ImpressionCounter(models.Model):
    ...    

    class Meta:
        ...
        constraints = [
            models.UniqueConstraint(fields=['ad', 'impression_date'], name='unique_ad_impression_date')
        ]
```

### 6. Create the migration for the constraint

The following command will create the migration for the constraint. It will not use the existing index by 
default.

```bash
% python manage.py makemigrations
```

Edit the migration to use the existing constraint.

Start off by the SQL commands for the migration and reverse migration:

```bash
% python manage.py sqlmigrate ads 0014
% python manage.py sqlmigrate ads 0014 --reverse
```
By using SeparateDatabaseAndState and the SQL commands from above, you can write the database modification by 
hand while still keeping Django informed about the migration.

```python
from django.db import migrations, models


class Migration(migrations.Migration):

    dependencies = [
        ('ads', '0013_create_index'),
    ]

    operations = [
        migrations.SeparateDatabaseAndState(
            database_operations = [
              migrations.RunSQL(
                sql=
                """
                    ALTER TABLE "ads_impressioncounter" ADD CONSTRAINT "unique_ad_impression_date" UNIQUE ("ad_id", "impression_date") USING INDEX (ads_impressioncounter_idx);
                """,
                reverse_sql="""
                    ALTER TABLE "ads_impressioncounter" DROP CONSTRAINT "unique_ad_impression_date";
                """),
            ], state_operations= [
                migrations.AddConstraint(
                    model_name='impressioncounter',
                    constraint=models.UniqueConstraint(fields=('ad', 'impression_date'), name='unique_ad_impression_date'),
                ),
            ]
    ]
```
